# Classification Neural Network
Problem Statement : The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. Our task is to build a classification model on the given data using any Deep Learning approach 

## It contains
1.	jupyter notebook of the model and the pre-processing operations.
2.	The h5 model that I have trained.
3.	The Loss and Accuracy graphs in proper format. (Both Training and Validation)
4.	Final performance measures of your model including validation accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score.
